2. Search for `Horizon` and choose "Horizon Theme" by Jonathan Olaleye
3. Click **Install**
4. Click **Reload** to reload VS Code
5. Navigate to File > Preferences > Color Theme and select **Horizon**
6. You're all set! Enjoy! üéâ

# Tweaks

## Font
The font used in the preview is **Roboto Mono**. You can download it [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono).

After you've downloaded and installed it, open your editor's settings and add the following...
```
"editor.fontFamily": "Roboto Mono"
```

## Contrast
Horizon has a seamless appearance across the different elements of VS Code like the sidebar and editor. If you would like to add a border or tweak the background colors, you can do so in your editor's settings. Here is my recommendation, but feel free to use whatever colors you want.
```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "activityBar.background": "#1E2028",
  "activityBar.border": "#1E2028",
  "sideBar.background": "#1E2028",
  "sideBar.border": "#1C1E26"
}
```
